I am technically an aspiring biologist trying to code for fun (and visibly for bioinformatics). I write (not an expert) in both R and python, and am also a great fan of GIS and mapping of data using the languages aforementioned, as well as using QGIS. Honestly, I am learning a lot from these endeavors thanks to my thesis adviser who allowed me to discover and explore more about bioinformatics, a fusion of the paradoxes of my life: **my love for computers and my hate towards biology**.

I will write more here, but for now: *"Ite, finitum est.*
