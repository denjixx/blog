I found myself a new dilemma today. Staying up until the 5th year in college made me realize not to repeat something if it wasn'tt a mistake. I simply do not know how I should react to this new dilemma I have and I feel the very same feeling I had when I was still in my first year of study in this University. It felt so surreal and dreadful, I just want every damn thing to end. At this point it concerns me how to deal with returning back to the subjects that I should have just completed long before and forget them all straight right away. Well, things doesn't go according to plan I guess.

**TO THE FUTURE ME!!!**

Don't do it ever again.
