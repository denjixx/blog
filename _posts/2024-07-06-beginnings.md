I would always remember the first time I went to college, on the very first day of my traumatic college life that well turned to be six long years in the making. When I look back on that very first day, I would laugh and at the same time feel dreadful. How can someone spend that much time in college? Imagine expecting to stay for five but here goes me on my sixth (and hopefully the very final year). But well as they say, time flies and every moment counts. 

If there is something more meaningful than all these years are the companies that made me humble, that it is not always me but others too. God did not make you to think that you operate on yourself. Go out to the world and bring with you humility, because as I have learned it myself, there's no joy without people trying to make you realize that you are worth it and you deserve everything. It is noteworthy to say, "No person can define you," and that is true, it is you who should define yourself. BUT. What is the meaning of life without exemplified judgement? A judgement from a person that loves you truly, whether it be fraternal or transcendent, a person's judgement of your quality does not limit you and should not disallow you to always improve yourself: not for their benefit or satisfaction, but yours.

God so loved a humble man indeed, that in his silence, St. Joseph became that just and dignified man that he is. By the grace of God, he showed us this great acceptance of exemplified judgement. He was so much in disarray that he thought of leaving Mary out of fear of judgement, and yet this judgement made him realize that God is with him, and he never backed down. And even in the fear of Herod's wrath, God so loved him that he and the Holy Family was sent into exile to Egypt and returned home unscathed. Nonetheless, the greatest of all: a death so silent it was never recorded. Our Mother dear, stood in the midst of the dying Jesus on the foot of the Cross, without Joseph by his side because even before everything in Jesus' ministry began, the foster father of Our Saviour was called upon by the Creator from this transient life to the bosom of Abraham our Father in faith. How humble a death like his could be! Truly a man worth emulating.

In all these years, I have to learn a lot of things and on my sixth year, I am quite that excited, perhaps ecstatic. But at the same time, with many doubts and fears... yet I know that I am not alone in this fight nor am going to be. Whether it be friends, or family, or the person I love, I know everyone will be there to always teach me humility. May St. Joseph and all the saints of God guide us to be better each day and every moment in time.
